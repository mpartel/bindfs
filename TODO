Major (i.e. probably not very soon):

- Applying options to a subset of all files;
  something like --if-file-matches '*.md5' { -u checksummer -p u+rw }
  - This would make for some new useful options like --hide or --deny
  - We could also have special xattrs like 'bindfs:perms' that
    don't get propagated to the base directory but control bindfs behaviour
    instead.
  - All this leads to the thought of an integrated minilanguage.
    Taken to the extreme, would this make bindfs almost yet another scripting
    language binding for FUSE?
    - Stackable/pluggable scripts? Any benefit over a remount?

Minor:

- Decide what to do with the fuse options uid=N and gid=N, or at least
  mention them in the docs.

- Look at capabilities instead of uid==0 when checking for special privileges.
  Do this in a portable way and fall back to uid==0 if not available.

- add real diskspace limiting (quota) besides of ability to report fake size.
  Maybe there can be even different limit for different paths? dunno.
  I think it's good idea to have sepparate code for faking reported size and
  limiting size, so user can decide if he wants both or only one of them.
